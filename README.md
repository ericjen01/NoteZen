## Background 
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Often I like to translate my learning experience and ideas into writing. Keeping and revisiting these written notes had grdually become cumbersome as I do not have a structured way to organize the notes. This motivates me to come up with an app.

## Design Features
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

 The final product of his project should offer features below  to optimize the notes management:
  - 🔍 Search box to find notes by keywords
  -
