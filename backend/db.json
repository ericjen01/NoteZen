Te create-react app now comes with built-in support for typescript. 2. React fragments allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This can be useful when you need to render a list of items without adding extra markup. Use fragments all the time to tidy up the DOM and improve readability. 3. Use of PropTypes PropTypes allow you to valicreated the props you pass to a component. Using PropTypes can help you catch errors early and make your code more maintainable. During development, React will log an error to inform you if any component is missing a necessary prop or receives the incorrect type for one of the props. To determine if the received data is valid or not, it exports a variety of validators.",
